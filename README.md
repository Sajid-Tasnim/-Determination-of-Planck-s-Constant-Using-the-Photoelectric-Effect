By plotting `V₀` vs. `f`, the slope of the line equals `h/e`, allowing us to calculate Planck's constant.

## Objectives

- Observe the photoelectric effect with different light frequencies
- Measure the corresponding stopping potentials
- Plot stopping potential versus frequency
- Determine Planck’s constant from the slope of the linear graph

## Apparatus

- Photoelectric tube
- Set of monochromatic filters or LEDs (known frequencies)
- Voltmeter (to measure stopping potential)
- Variable power supply
- Light source
- Optical bench setup

## Procedure

1. Setup the photoelectric apparatus securely.
2. Illuminate the photoemissive material with monochromatic light of a known frequency.
3. Adjust the power supply to find the stopping potential where the photoelectric current ceases.
4. Record the frequency and corresponding stopping potential.
5. Repeat the process for at least 5 different frequencies.
6. Plot the graph of stopping potential (`V₀`) vs frequency (`f`).
7. Use the slope of the linear fit to calculate Planck’s constant.

## Results

Sample Data Table:

| Frequency (Hz) | Stopping Potential (V) |
|----------------|------------------------|
| `f₁`           | `V₁`                   |
| `f₂`           | `V₂`                   |
| `...`          | `...`                  |
